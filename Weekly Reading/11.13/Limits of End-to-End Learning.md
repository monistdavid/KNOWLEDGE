    End-to-End Learning
        end to end learning is a concept in machine learning, mostly in deep learning. The end represents both the raw
    input data and the output data. The model is directly trained on the raw data with minimum human intervention. 

Summary
===============

        This paper talks about the limitation of the end to end learning method. Mainly focusing on difficulties in 
    optimization, easy to ignore complex but important data structure, etc.
