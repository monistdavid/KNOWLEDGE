Understand the question
===============

    Contrastive Learning
    Contrastive learning is a technique in machine learning, particularly in the field of unsupervised learning, 
    where the model learns to distinguish between similar (positive) and dissimilar (negative) pairs of data points.
    It's often used in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. 


Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============
    1. why nonlinear transformations are also crucial, and what is the relationship between activation function
        and nonlinear transformation?
        1. all activation functions are nonlinear transformations, not all nonlinear transformations are activation 
            functions. Activation functions are a specific tool used within the broader scope of nonlinear 
            transformations in neural networks. So adding a nonlinear transformation at the end is similar to adding a 
            activation function (Just a different way to call it)
