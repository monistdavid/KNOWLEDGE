    Convolutional Networks
    A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model primarily used for processing data 
    that has a grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs are particularly effective for tasks like image 
    classification, object detection, and face recognition. 

Summary
===============

        This paper shows the insight of the convolutional network. Author uses a method called deconvnet.
    The convnet transfer the image to features, while the deconvnet do the opposite thing. By getting the
    features from the image, and use deconvnet to get the image back. If we repeating this process, 
    we could see the focused features (Visually). By doing it on every layer, we could know in detail
    how and what the convnet is extracting the features.
