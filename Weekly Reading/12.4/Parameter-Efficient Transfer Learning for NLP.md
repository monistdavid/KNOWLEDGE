    Transfer Learning
    Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a model developed for one task is reused as the 
    starting point for a model on another task. It's a popular approach in various fields of AI, especially in 
    situations where labeled data for a specific task is scarce or when training a model from scratch would 
    require a significant amount of computational power and time.

Summary
===============

        This paper provides a efficient way to do fine-tuning on the pre-trained model. The key idea is to add 
    few trainable parameters to the pre-trained model and then do fine-tuning. Thus it remains the main parameters
    unchanged, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing.
