    INTRINSIC DIMENSIONALITY
    Intrinsic dimensionality is a concept used in the field of machine learning and data analysis to describe 
    the underlying complexity or the minimum number of parameters needed to represent the structure of a dataset 
    or a model effectively. In simpler terms, it refers to the smallest number of variables required to capture 
    the essential information in a dataset or model without significant loss of information.
