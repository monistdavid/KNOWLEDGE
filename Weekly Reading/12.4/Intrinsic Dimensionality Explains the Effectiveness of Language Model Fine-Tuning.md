    INTRINSIC DIMENSIONALITY
    Intrinsic dimensionality is a concept used in the field of machine learning and data analysis to describe 
    the underlying complexity or the minimum number of parameters needed to represent the structure of a dataset 
    or a model effectively. In simpler terms, it refers to the smallest number of variables required to capture 
    the essential information in a dataset or model without significant loss of information.

Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============

    1. what is Compression-Based Generalization Bounds?
        These are theoretical bounds in machine learning that help to understand how well a model will 
        perform on new, unseen data (i.e., its ability to generalize). The concept is based on the idea that 
        if a model can be "compressed" without significant loss of information, it is likely to generalize better. 
        Compression in this context means representing the model with fewer parameters or in a simpler form.
        if the model could be compressed without significant loss of information, isn't it overfitting?
            Overfitting vs. Effective Compression:
            Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the 
            noise and random fluctuations. As a result, while it performs well on training data, its performance on 
            new, unseen data is poor because it has learned features that aren't actually relevant to the problem.
            Effective Compression, in contrast, means simplifying the model while retaining its ability to capture 
            the essential patterns in the data. This simplification often involves reducing the model's complexity 
            by decreasing the number of parameters (or finding a lower intrinsic dimensionality), which can actually 
            help prevent overfitting. A compressed model that maintains good performance is likely focusing on the 
            most salient features of the data.
    2. what is sparsification?
        When a model is said to be "redundant in their capacity," it means that the model has more parameters 
        (or complexity) than required for optimal performance on its tasks.
        Sparsification is a process in machine learning where you reduce the complexity of a model by systematically 
        removing some of its parts - typically weights or connections in a neural network - without significantly 
        affecting its performance. In the context of neural networks, this can involve setting a proportion of the 
        model's weights to zero, effectively "pruning" those connections. The idea is to identify and remove the 
        parts of the model that contribute the least to its output, thus simplifying the model.
