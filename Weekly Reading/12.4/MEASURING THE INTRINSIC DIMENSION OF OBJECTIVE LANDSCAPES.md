    OBJECTIVE LANDSCAPES
    "Objective landscapes" in the context of neural networks and machine learning refer to a conceptual and 
    mathematical representation of the optimization problem that a learning algorithm tries to solve. 

Summary
===============

        This paper studies the intrinsic dimension of a neuron network that is used to solve certain problems. 
    By randomly select a subspace in the network and gradually increase its parameters to get the intrinsic dimension
    of the network.
