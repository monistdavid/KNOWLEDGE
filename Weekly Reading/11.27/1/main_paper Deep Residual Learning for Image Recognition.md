    Deep Residual Learning

    Deep Residual Learning is a method for training very deep neural networks, and it was introduced to address the
    degradation problem commonly encountered in these networks. The key idea behind Deep Residual Learning is the use of
    residual blocks or residual functions. Let's break down this concept for better understanding:

Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============

    1. By using the identity mapping, we could make sure at least the deeper network could perform the same as the 
        shallower network. Then why there will be a degradation problem?
        firstly, identity mapping is hard to train as well.
