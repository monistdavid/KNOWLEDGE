    Deep Residual Learning

    Deep Residual Learning is a method for training very deep neural networks, and it was introduced to address the
    degradation problem commonly encountered in these networks. The key idea behind Deep Residual Learning is the use of
    residual blocks or residual functions. Let's break down this concept for better understanding:
