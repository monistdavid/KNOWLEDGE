    Image Search & Retrieval
    Image Search and Retrieval refers to the process of finding and retrieving images from a large database that are
    relevant to a given query. This query can be in various forms, such as text, another image, or even certain image
    attributes.

Summary
===============

        This paper mentioned another method to do the image retreiving and searching, which could largely decrease the
    searching time and memory usage while still keeping the high accuracy.
