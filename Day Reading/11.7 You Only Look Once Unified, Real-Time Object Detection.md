Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============

    1. Systems like deformable parts models (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the
        classifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire image 
        a. Human is getting attracted by the object differently based on their personal and lately
            experience. So it is probably not reasonable to look through the image as windown
    2. Our system divides the input image into an S Ã— S grid. If the center of an object falls into 
        a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.
        a. is the S a fix value for a trained model? Or a single Yolo model could provide infinitely S
            value and those S values are dynamic. so that it could fit a even small object detection
            task.
    3. YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region
        proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image uring training and test time so it implicitly 
        encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance.
        a. as it has the frame over 50 per sec, does it remember?
