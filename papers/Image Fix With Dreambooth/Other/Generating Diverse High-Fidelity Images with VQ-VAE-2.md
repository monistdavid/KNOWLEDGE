Summary
===============
        This paper purposed a method to generate high-fidelity images, which is called VQ-VAE-2. It is based on 
    Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), however, it separate the local information, such as texture, 
    with global information such as shape and geometry of objects.
