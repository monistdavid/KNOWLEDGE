Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============
    1. The order of the AI model:
        Fully supervised learning -> Neural Network 
        -> Pre-trained & Fine-tuned -> Prompt
        -----------------------------
        featured based -> automatically feature generation 
        -> decrease dataset requirement -> template based task completion
        -----------------------------
        what's next?
        As I mentioned before, language/text is a type of image, is it possible to generate the text as an image?
        The book "Story Of your life" describing this woman scientist studying allen's language and she found that 
        there is not an order of writing the allen language. Or it is not right to say write the language, but more 
        like drawing the language. Human being can only write the language lines by lines because it is easier to 
        comprehend and digest. Things are really weird that human being should be able to understand the images
        much faster than reading language. Then why do we read language instead of putting all the information in the 
        images and digest images directly.

    1. Making a model that instead of writing a paragraph, draw a paragraph from random direction.
