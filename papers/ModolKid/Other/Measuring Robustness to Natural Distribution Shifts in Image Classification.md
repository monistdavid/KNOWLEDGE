Questions From The Paper
===============


Additional Quesions and Personal Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============
    1. why it is the language model come out first instead of image model, audio model or video model:
        And which of the following has the most information:
        a. text
        b. image
        c. audio
        d. video
        for me from most to least information: d > c > b > a
        Easy to understand the video has the most information as it includes both image and audio, 
        even a little bit text. Compared with audio, the image is not including long sequencing, high dimensional
        data. Carefully thinking, text is a small category of image, it is a pattern composed of lines and shapes as well.
        But still I think image has more information, because it could contains colors, more complex shapes, lines and 
        combinations of all of them. 
    2. 
        

Creativity
==============
    1. make a image model that is completely trained with image, none text.
