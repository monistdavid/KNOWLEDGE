Summary
===============
    Evaluated on 204 ImageNet models in 213 different test conditions, this papers find out the
    robustness performance to the natural distribution shifts is far from closing the gap, there
    is much room about researching on this problem. Current robustness interventions, 
    while effective against synthetic perturbations, couldn't solve the problem with the real data.
