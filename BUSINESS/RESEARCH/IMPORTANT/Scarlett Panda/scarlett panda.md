    1. Sample Story:
        Plot line: 
            A tree named monist wants to talk with a dog which pees on him everyday..
        Story:
            In a small park nestled in the midst of a bustling city, there was a massive and majestic tree. This tree was unlike any other in the park, as it had a name - Monist. Now, Monist was a unique tree, and he was a chatterbox. He loved to talk to whoever came his way. Be it children or grown-ups, dogs or even cats, Monist had an excellent ear for listening. However, there was one creature Monist wished to speak to every single day.
            This creature was a dog named Max. Max was an adorable little terrier that had a quirkiest habit - he loved to pee on Monist, every day. Monist was perplexed by this. He had heard talk that some dogs marked their territory but didn't understand why Max had to do it daily.
            One day, as Monist was basking in the sun and soaking up all the nutrients he could, he saw Max trotting towards him. He braced himself for the inevitable, looking at Max and muttering, "Here comes the pee-pee boy."
            Max did his usual thing, marking Monist with his yellow stream. However, this time Monist spoke up and said, "Hey Max, why do you pee on me daily? Don't you see that it's not kind to defile someone else's space?"
            Max was awestruck, taken aback by Monist's words. No one had ever spoken to him that way. He looked at Monist quizzically and asked him why he was bothered -didn't he realise it was only the dog's way of serving notice?
            That's when Monist explained that he was nothing more than a huge leathery creature that couldn't see things from the perspective of a tiny little dog like Max. Monist was wired differently, and the dog too. Seeing life from only one angle would mean missing out on other possibilities.
            Max got it, and so the next day, he went back to Monist to apologise and rehydrationof their friendship. He even marked a different tree; one he didn't happen to speak to, but was everything like Monist. Monist was delighted. Max didn't have to stop marking his territory, but he understood now that his actions could sometimes cause suffering to others.
            Monist and Max became the best of friends, and soon everybody in the park knew of their curious friendship. Monist learned everything about every breed of dogs from Max, and Max, in turn, learned everything about every bird or bug in the sky or in the ground. In the end, Monist and Max became inseparable, and Max never peed on Monist again.
            The inspiring moral of this story is that we all witness life in different ways. Understanding and seeing things from someone else's perspective help us to become more accommodating and accepting of their actions. And even though we are all unique, we are all part of the same world and should share it with kindness.
