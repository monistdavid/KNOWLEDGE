Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH

    1. If we are building something for kids education with entertainment, we need to think through what exactly
        our product could help kids to learn, for example:
        Here are 5 Major skills that lego education promotes:
            Sensory Skills: In the early ages of life, the most learning happens through the senses. A child 
                    observes the surroundings, reacts to voices and smells, and adopts the basic understanding 
                    of object permanence and other concepts. As time passes, the sensory learning capacity
                    increases, and there is room for a sense of touch and feel. Lego education helps stimulate it, 
                    and it also helps create images and creative forms in mind.
            Motor Skills: After the sensory skills, motor skills are the most important thing. A child learns 
                    how to hold, grasp and fix the materials. Lego education gives an experience of learning 
                    through concrete objects. Children pick the blocks, place them together, push them tightly 
                    not to come out, and do various other things. All of this develops better functions of 
                    movement and muscles and increases motor activity.
            Cognitive Skills: A person should be able to think correctly and smartly, along with the ability 
                    to do physical work. Lego education provokes creativity, and it promotes oneâ€™s functions 
                    of creating new models and aligning pieces in multiple shapes and structures. Legos also 
                    help a child understand how everything makes up from the basics and progresses over a period.
            Problem-solving: One of the significant skill sets that an individual needs are the ability to 
                    solve problems. While playing with legos, a child faces minor issues like having two pieces
                    that do not go together. Upon practicing, a child gets perfect and better at merging the 
                    structures, creating clean shapes, and finding the right connections. This ability intrigues
                    the insights and expands the solution circles of the mind.
            Organization and uniformity: There is a way an aesthetic color scheme should form. It is not 
                    necessary, but we require it for good displays and better structures. Through lego education,
                    a child captures the abilities to place things in the right spots and sort colors that go 
                    together. Through lego education, children also learn the name of colors and much more.
