Summary
===============
        The key idea is to provide electric book for kids to listen and read. Parents could read it with kids
    at the same time.
        The book content is fascinating and attractive even to adult. The audio is also very amazed and funny. 
    For generating similar contents with AI, I believe there is needs to finetune the model.

Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============
        1. Seems like a lot of the kids products required parents or educators to login, which means their focus 
            are on the parents or educators. why?
            Kids are too young to register and login, parents or educators should guide them through.
            Parents and educators are the one who pay for the products.
        2. There are some cute and interactive design, like getting a character from an egg that needs to click to
            break the shell. Get daily signin reward, etc.
            These could be considered later.
        3. why kids story books are famous?
            1. when kids are reading or listening with story book, parents could requires less effort to take care
                of them
            2. kids could get to know the world
            3. improve kids creativity and imagination
            4. Given kids moral lessons. 
            5. improve kids language skills
        4. I don't see AI could write the whole kids story book with the same quality as human, which includes
            stories, images, contents organization, and audio. What could AI do here?
