Summary
===============
        The software tries to integrate all the learning experience to game experience. For example, the knowledge
    of plus and minus, can be represented as a game of balancing the weight between two sides.


Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============
    1. Why games are that famous within kids, why adults don't learn through games?
        Playfulness and enjoyment: Games are inherently playful and fun, capturing children's attention and 
        imagination. They provide an enjoyable and entertaining experience that engages their curiosity and 
        encourages active participation.

        Interactive and hands-on learning: Games often involve interactive elements, requiring children to 
        actively engage with the game mechanics, make decisions, and solve problems. This hands-on approach 
        allows for experiential learning, where children can explore concepts, experiment with different strategies, 
        and directly see the outcomes of their actions.
        
        Gamification of learning: Many educational games are designed with specific learning objectives in mind. 
        They incorporate educational content, such as math, language, science, or problem-solving skills, into a
        game format. By combining learning with play, these games make the learning process more enjoyable and 
        motivating for children.
        
        Progress and rewards: Games often include a sense of progression and rewards, such as levels, badges, 
        or points, that provide a sense of achievement and motivation. As children advance in the game, they 
        experience a sense of accomplishment, which reinforces their engagement and encourages them to continue 
        learning.
        
        Competition and collaboration: Games can foster healthy competition among children, motivating them to 
        strive for improvement and learn from their peers. They also provide opportunities for collaboration,  
        teamwork, and communication, as some games require players to work together towards a common goal. This 
        social aspect adds to the appeal and enjoyment of games.
