Summary
===============
        this game try to teach kids to code with games. Different from bored coding, it used a really cute and funny
    UI to teach kids to code. It tries to use basic concept from coding. Trying to encourage kids to build, 
    create and think logically. Kids can create a lot more things with the game instead of just following 
    the instruction.

Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============

    1. the game either gives kids a role or set a theme for kids, why is that?
        This is an example in codemonkey:
            Who are You?
            Each of us have someone close who loves, helps, and takes care of us. We will later choose the central 
            figure in our lives and thank them. In our game the main character is getting presents for their loved 
            ones. You can choose the sprite you would like to be your main character.This sprite will collect 
            two presents and give them to their loved ones.
