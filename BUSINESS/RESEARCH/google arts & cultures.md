Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============
    1. Does interaction play an important role in learning? Why? How important it is? 
        interaction is crucial for effective learning. It promotes active engagement, social and emotional 
        development, knowledge construction, retention, motivation, differentiation, and skill development. 
        Incorporating interactive elements into educational settings enhances the overall learning experience, 
        fosters deeper understanding, and empowers learners to become active, independent thinkers and lifelong 
        learners.
