Summary

    kids build up their confidence, self-esteem and learn to accept failure.

Questions and Thoughts Based on little RESEARCH
===============
    1. Why board games are popular?
        For adult: 
            Escapism and immersion: Board games have the power to transport players into different worlds 
            and narratives. Whether it's exploring a fantasy realm, managing a civilization, solving a mystery, 
            or embarking on an adventure, board games offer a form of escapism and immersion. They allow players 
            to temporarily step into a different reality and experience a sense of exploration, wonder, and 
            storytelling.
        For kids:
            I think it is just in reverse. As kids don't know about the world that much, they need a way to 
            experience the world, the board games could bring them imaginations of different world.
        But the core is the same: They are fun
