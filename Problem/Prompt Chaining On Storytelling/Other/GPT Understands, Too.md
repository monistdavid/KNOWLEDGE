Summary
===============
        This paper propose a method called p-tuning to help answer the real world questions. In the superglue task, 
    P-tuning sometimes performes even better result than surprivised BERT mode. P-tuning is a method that insert
    continuous prompt into a hard prompt template. By using differential algorithms, it sensitively change the 
    prompt with continuous prompt tokens in order to improve the performance of the prompt accuracy.
